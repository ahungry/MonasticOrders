# MonasticOrders
Monastic Orders of Faerûn (MO or MOoF) rebalances monk progression in order to provide viability at both low and high levels. It revises the three existing monks in an attempt to make them all balanced at all levels of play. It also adds four new Monk kits, inspired by various monastic orders throughout the Realms. 

## Compatibility
The current version of Monastic Orders (v0.4+) is designed to work with any of the released Enhanced Editions (BG:EE, BG2:EE, IWD:EE, EET). Many features of this mod rely heavily on the functionality added in the Enhanced Editions, and thus there are no plans to extend compatibility to the original games.  

Monastic Orders is also written with an eye for inter-mod compatibility, but, by design, it is incompatible with any other mod that introduces Monk kits or modifies the Monk class. If you are interested in enabling compatibility between your mod and Monastic Orders, please contact me on the Beamdog forums or via email (aquadrizzt@gmail.com). 

## Components 
Monastic Orders (v0.4+) currently has the following components. Note that the Core Revisions component will be required to install any of the other components, but all other components can be installed independently. 

### Core Revisions 
This component fundamentally overhauls the Monk class (and the Sun Soul Monk and Dark Moon Monk kits). Monks are now considered Thief kits by the engine and make use of a new Fighting and Defensive Style system that allows Monks to switch between various sets of combat bonuses. This component also patches Rasaad to make use of the new system and updates various Monk items to be usable by the new kits.
